ready to begin, download the necessary files in Assignment2.zip (http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9444/18s2/hw2/Assignment2.zip)

Unzip this archive by typing

`unzip Assignment2.zip`

You should then see the following files:

>data/  	  Directory containing the training and evaluation datasets.

>implementation.py  	 This is a skeleton file for your code. The assignment should be completed by modifying this file.

>runner.py	  This file is a wrapper around implementation.py and contains a large amount of pre-implemented functionality. An unedited version of this file must be used to generate your final model.

>glove.6B.50d.txt	  This is a text file containing the embedding vectors used in this assignment. Word embeddings have been shown to improve the performance of many NLP models by converting words from character arrays to vectors that contain semantic information of the word itself. In this assignment, we use GloVe embeddings, you can read more about them here.
